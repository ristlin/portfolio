        Performed weekly transfections, ChIP and CAT assays, and maintained cell cultures in a breast cancer research lab studying the ability of 
        environmental estrogen mimics to activate the estrogen receptor-alpha and increase the risk of breast cancer. 
        Contributed data toward the publication of multiple papers and applied lab results toward a senior thesis titled 
        “Dopamine activates estrogen receptor-alpha independently of the calcium and nitrite pathways.”
